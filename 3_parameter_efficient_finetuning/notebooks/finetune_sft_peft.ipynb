        "- Freezes the pre-trained model weights\n",
        "- Adds small trainable rank decomposition matrices to attention layers\n",
        "- Typically reduces trainable parameters by ~90%\n",
        "- Maintains model performance while being memory efficient\n",

        "2. Create and prepare the dataset for adapter training\n",

            "{'content': \"Okay, let's think about this step by step. There's a 61-year-old woman here who's been dealing with involuntary urine leakages whenever she's doing something that ups her abdominal pressure like coughing or sneezing. This sounds a lot like stress urinary incontinence to me. Now, it's interesting that she doesn't have any issues at night; she isn't experiencing leakage while sleeping. This likely means her bladder's ability to hold urine is fine when she isn't under physical stress. Hmm, that's a clue that we're dealing with something related to pressure rather than a bladder muscle problem. \\n\\nThe fact that she underwent a Q-tip test is intriguing too. This test is usually done to assess urethral mobility. In stress incontinence, a Q-tip might move significantly, showing urethral hypermobility. This kind of movement often means there's a weakness in the support structures that should help keep the urethra closed during increases in abdominal pressure. So, that's aligning well with stress incontinence.\\n\\nNow, let's think about what would happen during cystometry. Since stress incontinence isn't usually about sudden bladder contractions, I wouldn't expect to see involuntary detrusor contractions during this test. Her bladder isn't spasming or anything; it's more about the support structure failing under stress. Plus, she likely empties her bladder completely because stress incontinence doesn't typically involve incomplete emptying. So, her residual volume should be pretty normal. \\n\\nAll in all, it seems like if they do a cystometry on her, it will likely show a normal residual volume and no involuntary contractions. Yup, I think that makes sense given her symptoms and the typical presentations of stress urinary incontinence. Cystometry in this case of stress urinary incontinence would most likely reveal a normal post-void residual volume, as stress incontinence typically does not involve issues with bladder emptying. Additionally, since stress urinary incontinence is primarily related to physical exertion and not an overactive bladder, you would not expect to see any involuntary detrusor contractions during the test.\", 'role': 'assistant'}\n"

        "To answer this question, we need to look at some historical facts. In 1870 there were two German states: Baden-Wuerttemberg (German for \"Bavaria with Wurttenberg\" or Bavarian Palatinate), which had a long history as an independent principality before being annexed by Prussia during World War II; Saxony/Saxonschweiz (\"Saxon Schleswig\"), whose territory came under Prussian control after gaining its independence from Denmark through negotiations between Otto von Bismarck's Chancellor Wilhelmina zu Hohenzollern Wilhelm I & King Frederick William IV on August 26th - September  3rd. The former state has since been reincorporated into Süddeutsche Bundesrepubliken / Deutsches Volkskreuzgefahrzeug [DWDG], also called Deutschland über all diese Zeit [\"Germany Under All Time\n",

We can rewrite this expression as follows: (Note that we are working with positive integers here.)

        "The word \"fruit\" refers to something that grows on trees, such as an apple or banana; it can also be used for any edible plant with seeds inside (like tomatoes). Vegetables are different from fruits because they don't produce their own food through photosynthesis but instead grow by eating other living things called plants! Some common vegetables include broccoli florets (*), carrots*, bell peppers**, zucchinis**. You might have seen them growing in your garden when you were younger - just think about all those delicious little green ones popping up every time someone goes outside during hot summer days... That's what we call'vegetables'. Now let me explain how these two categories differ:\n",
